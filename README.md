## Description

For this project, I have taken a book search engine that utilises the Google Book API and was built using a RESTful API and refactored it to use a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server.

The app has been built using the MERN stack with a React.js front end, a MongoDB database and a Node.js/Express server.
